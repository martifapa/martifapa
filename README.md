# Hi there, I'm MartÃ­! ðŸ˜Š

I'm a Full-stack Developer with a focus on the JavaScript ecosystem. I have experience with React, Redux, Express, Node, SQL (Postgres), and NoSQL (MongoDB).

I also have experience in Python, mainly for web development (Django), data analysis (Pandas), and some machine learning (Scikit-learn), and web scraping (BeautifulSoup and Selenium).

I studied History and worked several years in business-related roles, and I have a passion for tech and computer programming. I am a self-motivated learner who loves to tinker with problems and come up with creative solutions. Outside of work, I enjoy reading about almost any topic (from History to Science) and keeping fit.
